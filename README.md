### Introduction
Hello Commander <Your Name Here> - Would you like to play Python Wars?

### Description
This is a very simple hello world project combined with a text-based adventure game using two different packages found on pypi.org.

### Python Packages Used
Ascii Art 4.4 - https://pypi.org/project/art/ 

Python-Wars-Solo - https://pypi.org/project/python-wars-solo/ 

### Requirements
Python 3.x

Pip

Pipenv

### How to Install and Run from Source Code
1. Download repository and unzip into target directory
2. Navigate to directory in command line
3. Use the command `pipenv install`
4. To start the program use the ocmmand `pipenv run .\main.py`

### Overview
This program operates in two parts:
  First - it asks for a username and then uses the Ascii Art package to translate it to word art and say hello.
  Second - it asks the user if they would like to play a game called Python Wars.

If the user does not, the program exits, if they do, the game launches. 

### How to Play the Game
The game is a simple input command, turn-based battle game, much of the fun would be lost by trying to explain the strategy.
similar to Star Trek on the Apple 2 computer - you pick a certain number of Klingons (Zargons) to fight and then try to outlast them.
